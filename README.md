This clock displays the time as a fraction of the total time in a day via a bar graph.
The clock has two buttons, one to set minutes and one for hours. The clock internally keeps track of time in both hours and minutes, but is then converted to a fraction of the total day and displayed. 

The clock needs a clean power supply otehrwise it will rapidly lose time.
